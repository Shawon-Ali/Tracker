Menstrual cycles range from 21-45 days in young women and 21-31 days in adults, with an average of 28 days. Bleeding lasts 2-7 days. It stops during pregnancy, does not resume in early breastfeeding, and ends at menopause (typically between 45-55 years).\n\nMenstrual hygiene products include disposable options like pads and tampons, as well as reusable ones like menstrual cups, cloth pads, and period-proof underwear.\n\nMenstrual suppression can occur through hormonal contraception or breastfeeding, with variation in how quickly menstruation returns after childbirth.',
